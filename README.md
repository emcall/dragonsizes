This is a program intended for players of the game Flight Rising. They can input the sizes of their dragons to compare them side-by-side. Dragons can be moved around the screen by clicking and dragging, and removed from the chart by dragging to the 'delete' box in the bottom corner of the screen. 
This is fan-made and in no way endorsed by or affiliated with Flight Rising. Dragon breeds and other concepts are (c) StormlightWorkshop and I do not claim ownership over the character designs.
